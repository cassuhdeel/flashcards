# flashcards
This flashCard application was created through React.js using JSX and HTML. The goal for this project was to display proficiency in my knowledge of React and front-end development. The single responsibility principle was enacted while building this application.

This app allows a user to study topics of their choosing by allowing the creating of flashcard decks. The app uses repetitive exposure techniques that instill memory retention in the student. Study methods such as these have proven to be effective.

I used React while creating this app because React allows for the user to interact more with the app. Through the use of React hooks, I was able to make the application more user accessible.

Enjoy!
